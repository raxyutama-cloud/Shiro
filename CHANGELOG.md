and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.4.2] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **Donation moved behind a server proxy**: the app no longer calls `api.buatqris.site` directly. It now posts to `https://www.api-shiro.my.id/qris/create` and `/qris/status`, served by a small Express proxy on the maintainer's server.
- **Token removed from the app**: `account_id` / `secret_token` now live only in `/var/www/qris-proxy/.env` on the server. `public/js/config/qris-config.js` is committed and holds nothing but the proxy URL, so no payment secret is embedded in the APK, IPA or desktop binaries anymore.
- **CI**: the `BQ_ACCOUNT_ID` / `BQ_SECRET_TOKEN` injection step was removed from all three workflows — builds need no repository secrets.

### Added

- **Webhook + status cache**: `/qris/create` registers a `callback_url`, and `/qris/webhook` accepts buatqris.site payment events after verifying `X-BuatQris-Signature` (HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body, timing-safe comparison; `X-BuatQris-Delivery` variants also accepted). `/qris/status` answers from that cache and calls the upstream at most once every 20s per transaction — buatqris.site rate-limits status checks to roughly one per 15–20 seconds, which otherwise produced intermittent 502s under 5-second app polling.
- **Proxy hardening**: per-IP rate limits (15 QR creations and 300 status checks per 10 minutes), amount validation (Rp1.000 – Rp10.000.000), transaction-id format validation, note sanitising, a 20s upstream timeout and a response whitelist so only the fields the app needs are ever sent out.
- **Operations**: `qris-proxy.service` (systemd, runs as `www-data`, auto-restart) behind an nginx `location ^~ /qris/` block on `www.api-shiro.my.id`, with CORS enabled for WebView, Tauri and web builds.

### Notes

- Builds up to v4.4.1 embedded the buatqris.site token inside the shipped binaries. If any of those were distributed, **rotate the secret token** in the buatqris.site dashboard and update `/var/www/qris-proxy/.env`.

---

## [4.4.1] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Dynamic donation (QRIS)**: the *Support Me* entry now opens a donation modal where the donor types any amount (min. Rp1.000) and an optional note. The QR code is created on demand through the buatqris.site API (`api_create_qris`), showing amount, total, admin fee and transaction ID, plus an *Open payment page* button.
- **Payment status**: after the QR is shown the modal polls `api_check_status` every 5 seconds and reports `pending` → `success` / `expired` / `failed`, with a toast when the payment lands. Polling stops as soon as the modal closes.
- **Static fallback**: if the QRIS credentials are missing, the modal hides the form and points to the static `qris-shiro.jpeg` instead.
- **Credential safety**: `account_id` / `secret_token` are **not** stored in the repository. `public/js/config/qris-config.js` is gitignored and generated during CI from the `BQ_ACCOUNT_ID` and `BQ_SECRET_TOKEN` GitHub Actions secrets; a committed template lives at `public/js/config/qris-config.example.js`.

### Changed

- **Support Me** button in Settings opens the donation modal instead of linking straight to the QRIS image.
- **Version**: bumped to 4.4.1 (`versionCode` 21 on Android).

### Notes

- The API is called with `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST to `https://api.buatqris.site`. It sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so the same code path works from the Android WebView (`CapacitorHttp`), the Tauri desktop builds (`tauri_http_request`) and plain web builds (`fetch`).

---

## [4.4.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **Rebrand**: Application renamed from **Mori** to **Shiro** across the UI, app name, download folders (`/Download/Shiro`), themes, CSS classes, storage keys, and all 9 languages.
- **Maintainer**: Developer credits updated to **Raxy Utama** — GitHub `raxyutama-cloud`, Instagram `@yudhhaa23`, email `raxy.utama@gmail.com`.
- **Report a Bug**: now opens the Shiro GitHub issue tracker with device info prefilled (previously WhatsApp to the original developer).
- **Share & Updates**: share text, update checks, repository links, badges, and landing-page links now point to `raxyutama-cloud/Shiro`.
- **Support**: the "Support Me" entry now opens the **Shiro api QRIS** code (also shown in README and on the landing page) instead of Sociabuzz.
- **Version**: bumped to 4.4.0 (`versionCode` 20 on Android).

### Notes

- The application identifier remains `com.mori.downloader`: the bundled native security libraries (`libmorisec.so`, `morisec.obj`, `libmorisec.a`, `mori_get_engine_key`) export symbols bound to that package name, so changing it would break the scraper runtime.
- Shiro is an independent, rebranded derivative of [Mori](https://github.com/coflyn/Mori) by coflyn, distributed under GPL-3.0.
